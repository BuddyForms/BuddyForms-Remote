BuddyForms Remote provides your Forms where ever they are needed! Use BuddyForms Forms on any Website (WP and NON WP Sites) Inline or as Toggle.


== Description ==

A Toggle is the most advanced and user friendly why of writing.
It is used by many help services to give users a quick access to support and get in contact.
Its used by many famous mail provider like Google Inbox to write mails
And its a super comfortable why to encounter your user to write.

On the main site or on any site. The Toggle embed works everywhere with just one line of code. Its super easy to use ;)

<h4>Toggle:</h4>
You can use the Toggle out of the box. Just enable "Remote Forms" in the "Form Builder" and generate your embed code. Use it everywhere.

<h4>iFrame:</h4>
Use the endpoints generated for the Toggle for any other integration like Facebook or any site where you are able to use iFrames.
With Remote Forms enabled you will have two new endpoints views for the form and your post listings.

<h4>The Endpoints</h4>
1. View the logged in users posts
2. View the Form to create or edit posts

<h4>How it Works</h4>
If you generate the embed code you actually generate one line of JS
This line of JS does all the magic. It loads all needed code and generates the Toggle without any further step needed from your site.
Just embed the embed code where ever you need it and you are done.

If you use the endpoints in iframes, a special template is called without header and footer. just your form is delivered. This makes it possible to use your form or post lists without loading your complete Theme.
